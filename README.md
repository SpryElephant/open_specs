# open_specs

A collection of specification files designed to empower individuals to build their own solutions using AI-assisted development.

## What is this?

This repository is a compilation of spec files that describe various ideas, features, and systems. Rather than providing finished code or implementations, we share the **ideas** and **specifications** — the building blocks you need to create something tailored to your own needs.

## Philosophy

The core belief behind this project is simple:

- **Share ideas, not implementations** — Everyone has different requirements, tech stacks, and preferences. By sharing specifications rather than code, we give you the flexibility to build exactly what you need.
- **Your AI, your way** — Use your preferred AI development tools and workflows to turn these specs into working solutions.
- **Build and maintain for yourself** — You own and control your implementation. Customize, extend, and maintain it according to your specific needs.

## How to Use

1. Browse the specs in this repository
2. Find one that interests you or solves a problem you have
3. Use your preferred AI development approach to build it
4. Customize the implementation for your specific requirements
5. Maintain and evolve your version independently

## Contributing

Have a great idea or specification to share? Contributions are welcome! Submit your spec files and help grow this collection of ideas that others can build upon.

## License

Feel free to use these specifications to build your own implementations. The specs are shared openly for the community to benefit from and build upon.
